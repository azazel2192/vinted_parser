# vinted_parser
parser for vinted.cz
Drobpox is used for storing cookies and list of sellers that were parsed before. You need to put your dropbox app token at the start of dbx.py file.
Also you need an account at vinted.cz to parse, '_vinted_fr_session' is the cookie that we need. Grab it and put it in the 'cookie.txt' file in the root directory 
of your dropbox. After that you're good to go.
